Valued Internet passerby,

I'm a 40-something engineering director at a fairly successful midsize tech company.  I've helped grow it from 10 people to over 2,000 in 8 years.  We had a strong IPO along the way in 2018.

I've worked in a few non-profits, including founding a Christian church in the United States.  I helped lead it for 7 years.

Random topics of interest you might find on this website:

* technology, productivity, automation;
* angel investing (particularly to black entrepreneurs);
* leadership;
* ecclesiology (what is a church?);
* epistemology (what is truth?);
* languages (human and computer);
* communities;
* fitness;
* transportation 🚲;
* aviation;
* travel.

I'm also a father of teenagers, ama.

Love,

[Drew](mailto:website@draines.com?subject=I%20read%20your%20web%20site)
