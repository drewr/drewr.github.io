_Riding my bike humming Better Off Here by Glen Phillips_

I was recently humming a song I love and it occurred to me that the reason I love it, other than
the general beat and recording quality, is a tiny part of the chorus.  There is a major 2 chord.
The verses use a minor 2 repeatedly.  Aside from the chord choice, the artist layers an interesting
harmony over it.  Over the holidays I was playing the song on my guitar and enjoying figuring out this
little detail.

It made me think about the fact that the only difference between a musician and a regular person is
that a musician is curious why that sounds interesting.  A good musician can then turn that into a
decent recording or use it as inspiration for some other creative work.  But at the center of a musician's
desire is to find the right sound to produce a feeling in the listener.

When I think about how to find and motivate engineers, I usually come back to curiosity.  I sufficiently
curious person will stop at nothing to figure out a problem.  They'll get supplies, education, other
people---whatever is necessary---to satisfy that curiosity.
